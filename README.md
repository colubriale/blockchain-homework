Blockchain Case Study and Node Creation

## Blockchain Case Study

For this part one assignment, I will create a case study that analyzes how an Australian (as I am in Australia) FinTech blockchain company is using technology to solve a standing financial problem in Australia.

In this homework assignment, I will:

* Select a Australian FinTech blockchain company that interests me.

* Research the domain and company.

* Write a detailed case study of the company.

* Upload my case study to my git repository.

Reference the example [TokenFunder Case Study](Resources/TokenFunder_Case_Study.md) to get an understanding of the format and content that I'll need to write.

This assignment will challenge you to learn more about Australian advancements in the blockchain industry.
